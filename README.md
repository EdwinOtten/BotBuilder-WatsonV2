# Microsoft Bot Framework Connector for IBM Watson Assistant
A solution that connects Azure Bot Service to a bot that is build in IBM Watson Assistant. This allows you to make your IBM bot available on [all channels that are supported by Azure Bot Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channels-reference?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#summary-of-activities-supported-per-channel).

## WORK IN PROGRESS

Please note that this is a fork of [Vincent Perrin's repository](https://github.com/vperrinfr/BotBuilder-Watson). I am converting this so it works with IBM Watson Asisstant V2 API. This project is not functional yet, but you are welcome to [contribute](#Contributing).

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Update IBM SDK (replace `watson-developer-cloud` with `ibm-watson` package) | âœ… Done |
| Update README | ðŸ”„ In progress |
| Fix session management (application now creates a new session with IBM for every user message) | To do |
| Update Bot Framework Node.js SDK (`bot-builder`) to 4.x.x | To do |
| Add other storage options for state besides CosmosDB | To do |
| Update README | To do |
| Add a 'Deploy to Azure App Service' button | To do |

## Introduction

The Microsoft Bot Framework provides just what you need to build and connect intelligent bots that interact naturally wherever your users are talking, from text/sms to Skype, Teams, Slack, Office 365 mail and other popular services. [More details](https://dev.botframework.com/)

IBM Watson Assistant helps you to quickly build and deploy chatbots and virtual agents across a variety of channels, including mobile devices, messaging platforms. [More details](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant/)

## Prerequisites

The minimum prerequisites to run this sample are:

* Node.js 10 or above with NPM. Download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

* Bot Framework Emulator. Download it [here](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases/latest). More information about the emulator can be found in [this documentation article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-debug-emulator?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp).

* Credentials of your Watson Assistant

  * This project requires some credentials to be able to communicate with your Watson Assistant. The [Instructions](#Instructions) paragraph will explain how to configure this.
    
* Register your bot with the Microsoft Bot Framework. Please refer to [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/portal-register-bot) for the instructions. Once you complete the registration, update your bot configuration with the registered config values (See [Debugging locally using ngrok](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/debug-bots-emulator) or [Deploying to IBM Bluemix](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/runtimes/nodejs/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-node-js-on-bluemix))

* An Azure CosmosDB

## Instructions

1. Create an IBM Cloud & a Watson Assistant project

    * In case, you don't have it: [Register for IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration), or use an existing account

2. Acquire Watson Assistant credentials

  * Check out the `.env_example` file to see which settings are required. To find the credentials, read IBM's documentation on this: [Finding credentials in the UI](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v2#finding-credentials-in-the-ui).

3. Acquire Azure App registration details

4. Copy or rename the .env_example file to .env (nothing before the dot) and add your Watson Assistant details and Microsoft Bot app keys.

5. Before deploying that code, I recommend you fork it to test it locally with BotFramework emulator. [more details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/debug-bots-emulator)

6. Set up your Azure storage with the following steps.
  * Create an Azure account if you dod not already have one. This should be the account that you used for creating your bot
  * Create a CosmoDB database inside that account named _botdocs_  
  ![screenshot_new_db](readme_images/screenshot_new_db.png) 
  * Inside that database, create a collection named _botdata_ make sure that the partition key is _id_
  ![screenshot_add_container](readme_images/screenshot_add_container.png) 
  * Make a note of the _PRIMARY KEY_ associated with your account. This must be stored in the environment file as _storageKey_
  * Take note of the URI associated with your bot account, It will be something like :
https://<bot_name>.documents.azure.com:443/ - this will be the _storageURL_ you will save in your environment file below.
